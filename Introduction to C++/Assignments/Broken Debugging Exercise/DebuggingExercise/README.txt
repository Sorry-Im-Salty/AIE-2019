WELCOME TO DODGY BLACKJACK!!

Your aim is to find and fix all of the bugs to make this a functional game of Blackjack.

Rules of Blackjack:
 - standard 52-card deck (4 suits, 13 ranks per suit from 'two' to 'ace')
 - rank cards are worth their numerical value, jack/queen/king are worth 10, and an ace is either 1 or 11
 - player is dealt 2 cards and can choose to HIT or STAND
	- HIT the player is dealt an additional card
	- STAND the player is dealt no further cards and it is now the dealer's turn
 - dealer deals themselves cards until they have a combined score of higher than the player, at which point they STAND
 - the aim is to get a combined score of 21 with your cards, or closer to 21 than the dealer without going over
 - going over 21 is called BUST and the player automatically loses if they BUST, without the dealer having a turn

The code provided was once a working game of Blackjack that followed the rules above. When a game ended the player 
could select to either play again or exit.

A crazed coder has hacked apart the working code and filled it with Compile errors, Link errors, Execution errors, 
and Logic errors. There are also other bugs that aren't easily defined by those tags.

You must find and fix as many bugs as you can so that Blackjack once again runs as expected!

You have been provided with a working executable to compare with.
